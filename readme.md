# Unit Converter
Its an application which converts one unit to another unit.
like :- kg to g || hours to sec etc...
***
## Journey
This was my first application although late updated on github here.

I tries to make is as good as possible, at place of just adding a convert button I added a functionality so that as user changes input value the conversion takes place just like when we try to convert units in google.

Although it was my first project in android development but this helped me in learning *TextWatcher* interface of android.

At the end I successfully developed this application and here's my project, please download it and check it out.

**NOTE**  : `I can't provide APK becuase till now I don't know how to sign APK so please consider generating APK from my code given in this repository.`
